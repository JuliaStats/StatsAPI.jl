    vif(m::RegressionModel)

Compute the variance inflation factor (VIF).

The [VIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_inflation_factor) measures
the increase in the variance of a parameter's estimate in a model with multiple parameters relative to
the variance of a parameter's estimate in a model containing only that parameter.

See also [`gvif`](@ref).

!!! warning
    This method will fail if there is (numerically) perfect multicollinearity,
    i.e. rank deficiency. In that case though, the VIF
    is not particularly informative anyway.

"""
    gvif(m::RegressionModel; scale=false)

Compute the generalized variance inflation factor (GVIF).

If `scale=true`, then each GVIF is scaled by the degrees of freedom
for (number of coefficients associated with) the predictor: ``GVIF^(1 / (2*df))``.

The [GVIF](https://doi.org/10.2307/2290467)
measures the increase in the variance of a (group of) parameter's estimate in a model
with multiple parameters relative to the variance of a parameter's estimate in a
model containing only that parameter. For continuous, numerical predictors, the GVIF
is the same as the VIF, but for categorical predictors, the GVIF provides a single
number for the entire group of contrast-coded coefficients associated with a categorical
predictor.

See also [`vif`](@ref).
